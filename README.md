# password-generator

## Instillation 

To  use this application you will need to fork and set up the index.html, script.js, and style.css files. Once you link them and host the files the application will run properly. You may view a deployed version of this application [here](https://bcshanken.github.io/password-generator/).

## Usage

To start the application hit the generate button.

Then the browser will ask you how many characters your password will include. The number should be typed as a integer between 8-128, an error message will display if not done properly.

The next step is a series of yes or no questions asking what type of characters you would like.

After you finish answering the questions about uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters and numbers your password will be generated.
